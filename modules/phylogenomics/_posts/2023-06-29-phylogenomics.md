### Phylogenomics basis and applications

Phylogeomics implements various bioinformatics techniques to study the reltionship amongst organisms using various types of data. Investigating the evolutionary relationship between organisms aids in identifying the appropriate genealogical ties resulting in evolutionary trees which describes a historical record relating to the the points of divergence between origanisms. 
By chronicling these divergence points, researchers aim to develop an understanding of the relatedness of species, how they have evolved over time and to construct the ancestral lineages which give rise to the diversity of life on Earth. Phylogentic analysis is a procedure which involves researchers gathering data from the organisms under investigation, such as DNA sequences, protein sequences, anatomical features, physiological features and paleontological features in tandem with computational tools and statistical methods to infer the similarities and differences among organisms.
